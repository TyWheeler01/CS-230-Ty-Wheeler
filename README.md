#	The Gaming Room client needed a web-based game application “Draw It or Lose It". They required a software design that allowed players to draw images based on given phrases, while other players guessed the phrase based on the drawing. The application had to be accessible on multiple operating platforms and offer a seamless and engaging user experience while being responsive and secure. 
#	I ensured that every aspect of the game design and requirements was thoroughly detailed, providing clear descriptions and specifications. The documentation was well-organized, following a logical flow that made it easy to understand the project’s objectives, requirements, and implementation steps. I paid close attention to technical accuracy to ensure all specifications and design elements were clearly described for implementation. I included all necessary components, from user interface design to backend functionality, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the project. The documentation effectively communicated the project goals and requirements to the client which facilitated better understanding between the client and development team and collaboration between the two.
	The design document served as a clear roadmap of the project. It outlined the architecture, components, and interactions which all helped in understanding the overall structure and flow of the application. By documenting the software requirements the design document ensured a precise understanding of what needed to be implemented. This prevented any scope creep and helped to maintain focus on the core features that were most significant to the program. The process of creating the design document required thorough planning which translated into more efficient and organized coding. It allowed for identifying potential challenges early on to come up with strategies to address them. The design document laid the groundwork for testing and quality assurance. By defining the expected behaviors and outcomes it helped in creating relevant test cases and ensuring the final product met the specified requirements.
	If I could choose one part of the "Domain Model" section of my work on these documents to revise, it would be the clarity and detail of the relationships and behaviors between classes. I’d provide more specific descriptions of each class, including their attributes and methods. For example, instead of just mentioning that the `GameService` class manages the lifecycle of `Game` instances, I would describe its key methods such as `createGame()`, `addTeamToGame()`, and `removePlayerFromTeam()`. I’d also elaborate on the composition relationships by describing how they are implemented in code. For instance, explain how the `Game` class holds a list of `Team` objects and how the `Team` class manages its `Player` objects, including any relevant methods for adding and removing these objects. Also adding example use case scenarios to illustrate how the classes interact in typical operations. This would help clarify the practical application of the domain model and demonstrate its functionality. I’d also include more detailed descriptions of the behaviors and interactions between the classes. For example, explain how a `Player` joins a `Team` and how this affects the state of the `Game`. Also adding a section explaining the rationale behind certain design choices would be beneficial such as why a singleton pattern is used for `GameService` or why inheritance was chosen for the `Entity` class. This would provide deeper insight into the design decisions and their benefits.
	Interpreting the user’s needs and implementing them into the software design is a critical process that involves understanding the requirements and expectations of the end users and stakeholders. I started by thoroughly reviewing the requirements provided by The Gaming Room, focusing on their need to create a web-based game application similar to "Draw It or Lose It”. Key requirements included support for multiple operating systems, the ability to create and manage games, teams, and players, and ensuring scalability and security. Created UML diagrams and domain models to visualize the relationships and interactions between different parts of the system. This helped ensure that all user requirements were addressed structurally. Focused on designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring that users could easily navigate and perform necessary actions. Emphasized usability and simplicity in the UI/UX design to cater to both technical and non-technical users. Designed the application with scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of more games and users without performance degradation. Incorporated security measures such as user authentication and data protection to meet the client’s needs for a secure gaming environment. Interpreting and implementing user needs into software design is a foundational aspect of software development. It ensures that the final product is user-centric, functional, and capable of meeting the expectations of its intended audience.
	Approaching software design involves a structured and methodical process to ensure that the final product meets user requirements and performs efficiently. I had thoroughly analyzed the user’s needs and functional requirements provided by the client. System modeling was crucial in how class diagrams were made to represent the structure of the system, defining classes, attributes, methods, and relationships. A layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability helped significantly. This included layers such as presentation, business logic, and data access. Functional prototypes to demonstrate key features and functionalities also moved the project along. The detailed software design document outlining the architecture, domain model, use cases, and class diagrams provided a basis for designing the software. Technical specifications, errors and other general problems were all documented. Designing software requires a comprehensive and iterative approach that includes understanding requirements, modeling the system, prototyping, and continuous feedback. In future projects, I would incorporate advanced modeling techniques, user-centered design principles, and modern architectural patterns to enhance the design process and ensure the development of robust, user-friendly, and scalable software applications.
